# redborder-serverspec-manager
Infrastructure integration testing for redborder-manager

# Basic documentation
https://serverspec.org/

# Considerations
The tests should be divided in directories based on the system to test. The target of each subdirectory is to test isolated systems
We preffer to have duplicated code rather than helpers or function factories
If possible, on each task, the developer should update this repo with the corresponding tests
